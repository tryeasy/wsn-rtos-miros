The current MIROS has the following features:

A). Hybrid scheduling model (both event-driven scheduler and multithreaded scheduler are implemented, two schedulers can switch to each other when necessary). With this scheduling model, the real-time OS can be achieved with low memory consumption.

B). Dynamic memory allocation, heap space is extendable and the memor fragments can be assembled.

C). Mid-layer software EMIDE embedded inside the MIROS. The WSN application can be decoupled from the low-level system. The programming process will be simplied, and the reprogramming performance will be improved.

D). Combination of both the software and the multi-core hardware technologies to achieve the energy conservation, improve the node reliability and develop a new OS debugging way.

E). State-machine programming for the system services to improve the software reliability further (using the state-machine checking and validation, the roll-back recovery, etc.).

F). Application GUI tools development to generate the application code automatically.
